The sensor gives both digital and analog output. The difference between the two is very simple in digital output only high or low means either 1 or 0 is transmitted to the microcontroller but in the analog signal, 
a wide range of values from 0 to 1023 is transmitted to the microcontroller which corresponds strength of the gas in the environment and goes on increasing for mor4e dense fumes the sensor is built out of LM393 IC which has an inbuilt amplifier which amplifies the voltage signal to the detectable range. 
Also, it has voltage comparators for efficient amplification. The amount of amplification can be adjusted with connecting potentiometers.
